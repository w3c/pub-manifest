			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification defines a general manifest format to describe publications. It does not attempt to
					constrain the nature of the publications that use the manifest. Rather, it is designed to be
					adaptable to the needs of specific areas of publishing, such as audiobook production, by specifying
					a modular approach for creating specializations.</p>

				<p>This specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures. While it is
					expected that traditional Web user agents (browsers) will be able to consume a publication manifest,
					this should not limit the capabilities of any other possible type of user agent (e.g., applications,
					whether standalone or running within a user agent, or even publications that include their own user
					interface).</p>

				<p>This specification does not define how user agents are expected to render publications that use the
					manifest format.</p>

			<section id="manifest-intro">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<section id="manifest-format" class="informative">
					<h4>Manifest Format</h4>

					<p>A <a>digital publication</a> is described by its <a>manifest</a>, which provides a set of
						properties expressed using a specific shape of JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]] format (a variant of
						JSON&#160;[[ecma-404]] for linked data).</p>

					<p>A <a>digital publication's</a>
						<a>manifest</a> is defined by a set of properties that describe the basic information a user
						agent requires to process and render the publication. For ease of understanding, these
						properties are categorized as follows:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Descriptive properties describe aspects of a digital publication, such as its <a
									href="#pub-title">title</a>, <a href="#creators">creator</a>, and <a
									href="#language-and-dir">language</a>.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							<a href="#resource-categorization-properties">resource categorization</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Resource categorization properties describe or identify common sets of resources, such as
								the <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order"
									>default reading order</a>. These properties refer to one or more resources, such as
								HTML documents, images, script files, and separate metadata files.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p class="note">These categorizations have no relevance outside this specification (i.e., the
						properties are not actually grouped together in the manifest).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-jsonld">
					<h4>JSON-LD Authoring and Processing</h4>

					<p>This specification defines the publication manifest as a specific "shape" of [[!json-ld]]. This
						means that the manifest SHOULD be expressed using only the syntactical constructions as defined
						in this specification, as opposed to all the possibilities offered by the JSON-LD syntax.</p>

					<p class="note">This shape is also defined, informally, through a JSON schema&#160;[[json-schema]]
						that expresses the constraints defined in this specification. This schema is maintained at <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/blob/master/schema/publication.schema.json"
							>https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/blob/master/schema/publication.schema.json</a>.</p>

					<p>The publication manifest also has a number of authoring flexibilities and compact authoring
						expressions. For example, it is not always required that object types be explicitly authored, as
						these are automatically generated during canonicalization when missing (see <a
							href="#value-objects"></a> for more information). A <a>canonical representation</a> of the
						manifest data is defined separately; see the separate section on <a href="#webidl"></a> for
						further details.</p>

					<p>As a consequence, a user agent does not have to be a full JSON-LD processor. User agents only
						need to be able to read the manifest's specific shape and internalize the data.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-schemaorg">
					<h4>Relationship to Schema.org</h4>

					<p>Manifest properties are primarily drawn from <a href="https://schema.org">schema.org</a> and its
							<a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">hosted extensions</a>&#160;[[schema.org]], in
						particular those categorized as <a href="#descriptive-properties">descriptive properties</a>. As
						a consequence, these properties inherit their syntax and semantics from schema.org, making
						manifest authoring compatible with Schema.org authoring.</p>

					<p>When a manifest item corresponds to a schema.org property, its <a href="#manifest-properties"
							>property definition</a> table identifies its mapping and includes the defining type (e.g.,
							<a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> or <a
							href="https://schema.org/Book">Book</a>) in parentheses. Properties are often available in
						many types, however, as a result of the schema.org inheritance model. Refer to each property
						definition for more detailed information about where it is valid to use.</p>

					<p>Schema.org additionally includes a large number of properties that, though relevant for
						publishing, are not mentioned in this specification. These properties MAY be used in a manifest
						as this document defines only the minimal set of manifest items.</p>

					<p>For more information about using additional schema.org properties, refer to <a
							href="#publication-types"></a> and <a href="#extensibility-manifest-properties"></a></p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="manifest-requirements">
				<h5>Requirements</h5>

				<p>All implementations of the a <a>digital publication</a> manifest MUST set the following:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#manifest-context">context</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#publication-types">type</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#default-reading-order">default reading order</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#pub-title">title</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p class="note">Not all of these properties have to be serialized in the manifest. Refer to each
					property's definition to determine whether, and how, it is compiled into the <a>canonical
						representation</a> from other information.</p>

				<p>The priority of all other <a href="#manifest-properties">properties</a> and <a href="#manifest-rel"
						>resource relations</a> is OPTIONAL, but MAY be modified by implementations of the manifest
					format.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="webidl">
				<h3>Web IDL</h3>

				<p>Although a <a>digital publication</a>'s manifest is authored as [[!json-ld]], a user agent <a
						href="#manifest-processing">processes this information</a> into the <a>canonical
						representation</a>, which can be in any language, in order to utilize the properties.</p>

				<p>To simplify the manifest format for developers, this specification defines an abstract representation
					of the data structures employed by the manifest using the Web Interface Definition Language (Web
					IDL) [[!webidl-1]] — <a href="#webidl-wpm">the <code>PublicationManifest</code> dictionary</a>.</p>

				<p>This definition expresses the expected names, datatypes, and possible restrictions for each member of
					the manifest. Unlike a typical Web IDL definition, however, user agents are not expected to expose
					the information in the manifest as an API. The Web IDL language is chosen solely to provide an
					abstraction of the data model.</p>

				<p class="note">It is not necessary to understand the Web IDL definition in order to create digital
					publications. Authoring requirements are defined in the following sections.</p>

				<section id="webidl-wpm">

			<section id="manifest-context">
				<h3>Manifest Contexts</h3>

				<p>A <a>manifest</a> MUST set its JSON-LD context [[!json-ld]] with the following two components, in the
					specified order:</p>

				<ol>
					<li>the [[!schema.org]] context: <code>https://schema.org</code></li>
					<li>the publication context: <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context</code></li>
				</ol>

				<pre class="example" title="The context declaration.">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org", "https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context"],
    &#8230;
}
</pre>

				<p>The publication context document adds features to the properties defined in Schema.org (e.g., the
					requirement for the <a href="https://schema.org/creator">creator</a> property to be order
					preserving).</p>

				<p class="ednote">As part of the continuous contacts with Schema.org the additional features defined in
					the publication context file could migrate to the core Schema.org vocabulary.</p>

				<p class="note">Although Schema.org is often referenced using the <code>http</code> URI scheme, <a
						href="https://schema.org/docs/faq.html#19">the vocabulary is being migrated</a> to use the
					secure <code>https</code> scheme as its default. This specification requires the use of
						<code>https</code> when referencing Schema.org in the manifest.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="manifest-lang-dir">
				<h3>Manifest Language and Direction</h3>

				<p>Each natural language property value in a manifest (e.g., <a href="#pub-title">title</a>, <a
						href="#creators">creators</a>) has a default natural <dfn>language</dfn>, which is the language
					that it is expressed in (e.g., English, French, Chinese). It also has a natural <dfn>base
						direction</dfn> in which it is written — the display direction, either left-to-right or
					right-to-left.</p>

				<p>The digital publication manifest includes entries to set both these concepts to aid user agents in
					interpreting and presenting the metadata.</p>

				<section id="manifest-lang-dir-global">
					<h4>Global Declarations</h4>

					<p>The default language is set by including a language declaration in the context using the <a
							href="https://w3c.github.io/json-ld-syntax/#syntax-tokens-and-keywords"
								><code>language</code> key</a> [[!json-ld]]:</p>

					<aside class="example" title="Declaring French as the default language for the manifest">
						<pre><code>{
    "@context" : [
        "https://schema.org",
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context", 
        {"language":"fr"}
    ],
    "name" : "Le roi René"
}</code></pre>
					</aside>

					<p>The global language declaration MUST follow the <a href="#manifest-context">publication
							context</a> when present.</p>

					<p>The value of the <code>language</code> MUST be set to a language code that is well-formed as
						defined in [[!bcp47]].</p>

					<p>Unlike the default language, the default direction of the text cannot be specified in the context
						as JSON-LD does not currently include facilities for this. As an interim measure, this
						specification defines a <code>direction</code> property for this purpose, as described in the
						following table.</p>

					<table class="zebra">
						<thead>
							<tr>
								<th>Term</th>
								<th>Description</th>
								<th>Required Value</th>
								<th>Value Category</th>
								<th>[[!schema.org]] Mapping</th>
							</tr>
						</thead>
						<tbody>
							<tr>
								<td>
									<code data-dfn-for="PublicationManifest">
										<dfn>direction</dfn>
									</code>
								</td>
								<td>Default <a>base direction</a> for textual manifest values</td>
								<td><code>ltr</code>, <code>rtl</code>, or <code>auto</code></td>
								<td>
									<a href="#value-literal">Literal</a>
								</td>
								<td>(None)</td>
							</tr>
						</tbody>
					</table>

					<p>The <dfn data-lt="TextDirection">base language direction</dfn> MUST have one of the following
						values:</p>

					<ul data-dfn-for="TextDirection">
						<li><code><dfn>ltr</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally
							set to left-to-right text;</li>
						<li><code><dfn>rtl</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally
							set to right-to-left text;</li>
						<li><code><dfn>auto</dfn></code> indicates that the textual values are explicitly directionally
							set to the direction of the first character with a strong directionality, following the
							rules of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm [[!bidi]].</li>
					</ul>

					<p>No default values are specified for the global language or base direction.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-lang-dir-local">
					<h4>Item-Specific Declarations</h4>

					<p>It is possible to set the language locally for any textual value in the manifest using a <a
							href="#LocalizableString">localizable string</a>:</p>

					<pre class="example" title="Setting the author name to French using a localizable string">
{
    "@context" : ["https://schema.org","https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context"],
    "type"     : "Book",
    &#8230;
    "author" : {
        "type"  : "Person",
        "name" : {
            "value"    : "Marcel Proust",
            "language" : "fr"
        }
    }
}
</pre>
					<p>The value of the <code>language</code> MUST be set to a language code that is well-formed as
						defined in [[!bcp47]].</p>

					<p>When used in a context of localizable texts, a simple string value is a shorthand for a
							<a>localizable string</a>, with the <code>value</code> set to the string value, and the
						language set to the value of the <a href="#manifest-lang-dir-global">default
								<code>language</code> property</a>, if applicable, and unset otherwise. In other words,
						the previous example is equivalent to:</p>

					<pre class="example" title="Setting the default language of an author name to French">
{
    "@context"   : [
        "https://schema.org",
        "https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context",
        {"language": "fr"}
    ],
    "type"       : "Book",
    &#8230;
    "author"     : "Marcel Proust",
    &#8230;	
}
</pre>
					<p>See <a href="#value-objects"></a> for more information.</p>

					<p>It is <em>not</em> possible to set the direction explicitly for a specific value.</p>

					<p class="note">For more information about localized strings on the Web, refer to
						[[string-meta]].</p>

					<p class="note">Setting the direction for a natural text value is currently not possible in
						JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld]]. In case the JSON-LD community, as well as the schema.org community,
						introduces such a feature, future versions of this specification may extend the ability of
						manifests to include this.</p>

					<p>In order to correctly handle manifests entries containing right-to-left or bidirectional text,
						user agents SHOULD identify the base direction of any given natural language value by scanning
						the text for the first strong directional character.</p>

					<p class="note">In situations where the first-strong heuristics will produce the wrong result (e.g.,
						a string in the Arabic or Hebrew script that begins with a Latin acronym), content developers
						may want to prepend a Unicode formatting character to the string. This would then produce the
						necessary base direction when the heuristics are applied. They should use one of the following
						formatting characters: U+200E LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK, or U+200F RIGHT-TO-LEFT MARK. (See <a
							href="#app-bidi-examples"></a>.)</p>

					<p>Once the base direction has been identified, user agents MUST determine the appropriate rendering
						and display of natural language values according to the Unicode Bidirectional
						Algorithm&#160;[[!bidi]]. This could require wrapping additional markup or Unicode formatting
						characters around the string prior to display, in order to apply the base direction.</p>

					<p class="note">If authors intend to use a manifest, or a manifest template, both as embedded
						manifest and as a separate resource, they are strongly encouraged to set these properties
						explicitly to avoid interference of the containing <code>script</code> element in case of
						embedding.</p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="publication-types">
				<h4>Publication Types</h4>

				<p>A <a>digital publication's</a>
					<a>manifest</a> defines its <dfn>Publication Type</dfn> using the <code
						data-dfn-for="PublicationManifest"><dfn>type</dfn></code> term&#160;[[!json-ld]]. The type MAY
					be mapped onto <a href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork"
					><code>CreativeWork</code></a>&#160;[[!schema.org]].</p>

				<pre class="example" title="Setting a publication's type to CreativeWork.">
{

				<p>Schema.org also includes a number of more specific subtypes of <code>CreativeWork</code>, such as <a
						href="https://schema.org/Article"><code>Article</code></a>, <a href="https://schema.org/Book"
							><code>Book</code></a>, <a href="https://schema.org/TechArticle"
						><code>TechArticle</code></a>, and <a href="https://schema.org/Course"><code>Course</code></a>.
					These MAY be used instead of, or in addition to, <code>CreativeWork</code>.</p>

}
</pre>

				<p>Each Schema.org type defines a set of properties that are valid for use with it. To ensure that the
					manifest can be validated and processed by Schema.org aware processors, the manifest SHOULD contain
					only the properties associated with the selected type.</p>

				<p>If properties from more than one type are needed, the manifest MAY include multiple type
					declarations.</p>

				<pre class="example" title="A publication that combines properties from both Book and VisualArtwork.">
{

								string as its value, the value MUST be expressed either as:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>a single string value;</li>
								<li>an object with a <code>value</code> property containing a the property's text and a
										<code>language</code> property that identifies the language of the text.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>A single string value represents an implied object whose <code>value</code> property is
								the string's text and whose language is determined from other information in the
								manifest.</p>
						</section>

						<section id="value-object-entity">
							<h6>Entities</h6>

							<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects an entity (i.e., an
								individual or organization responsible for the various aspects of creation), its value
								MUST be expressed either as:</p>

							<ul>
								<li>a single string value;</li>
								<li>a <a href="#CreatorInfo">CreatorInfo</a> object.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>A single string value represents an instance of a CreatorInfo object whose
									<code>name</code> property is the string's text and whose <code>type</code> is
								assumed to be <a href="https://schema.org/Person">Person</a> [[!schema.org]].</p>

							<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of a Person object.">
								<p>The following author name is expressed as a text string:</p>

								<pre>

        "name" : "Herman Melville"
    },

								<p>(See <a href="#creators"></a> for further details.)</p>
							</aside>
						</section>

						<section id="value-link">
							<h5>Links</h5>

							<p>When a manifest property links to one or more resources, it MUST be expressed in one of
								the following two ways:</p>

							<ol>
								<li>as a string encoding the <a>URL</a> of the resources; or</li>
								<li>as an instance of a <a href="#publication-link-def"><code>LinkedResource</code>
										object</a> that can be used to express the URL, the media type, and other
									characteristics of the target resource.</li>
							</ol>

							<p>A single string value represents an implied <code>LinkedResource</code> object whose
									<code>url</code> property is set to the string value.</p>

							<pre class="example" title="Resource list that includes one link using a relative URL as a string ('datatypes.svg') and two that display the various properties of the a LinkedResource object">
{
    &#8230;
    "resources" : [

        {
            "type"            : "LinkedResource",
            "url"             : "test-utf8.csv",

    ]
}

						</section>
					</section>

					<section id="value-url">
						<h5>URLs</h5>

						<p><dfn data-lt="URL">URLs</dfn> are used to identify resources associated with a <a>digital
								publication</a>. When a property expects a URL value, it MUST be a <a
								href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string">valid URL string</a>
							[[!url]].</p>

						<p>Manifest URLs are restricted to only the <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>
							<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url-scheme">schemes</a> [[!url]]. URLs MUST
							dereference to a resource, although user agents are not required to dereference all URLs in
							the manifest.</p>

						<p>In the case of <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#relative-url-string">relative-URL
								strings</a>, these are resolved to <a
								href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#absolute-url-string">absolute-URL strings</a> using a
								<a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-base-url">base URL</a>&#160;[[!url]].</p>

						<p>The base URL for relative-URL strings is determined as follows:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>In the case of an <a href="#manifest-embed">embedded manifest</a>, it is the <a
									href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#inheriting-base-iri-from-html-s-base-element"
									>document base URL of the embedding document</a> [[!json-ld]];</li>
							<li>In the case of a <a href="#manifest-link">linked manifest</a>, it is the URL of the
								manifest resource.</li>
							<li>In the case of a digital publication format that uses <a
									href="#manifest-other-discovery">another means of discovering the manifest</a>, it
								is defined by the format.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>By consequence, relative-URL strings in embedded manifests are resolved against the URL of
							the document that references the manifest <em>unless</em> the document declares a base URL
							(i.e., in a <a data-cite="!html#the-base-element"><code>&lt;base&gt;</code> element</a> in
							its header).</p>

						<p class="note">URLs allow for the usage of characters from Unicode following&#160;[[rfc3987]].
							See <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/references.html#biblio-url">the note in the HTML5
								specification</a> for further details.</p>

					<section id="value-id">
						<h5>Identifiers</h5>

						<p>Identifiers are <a href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-url">URL records</a> [[!url]]
							that can be used to refer to <a class="externalDFN"
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/publishing-linking/#dfn-web-content">Web Content</a> in a
							persistent and unambiguous manner. <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locators">URLs</abbr>,

					<section id="value-array">
						<h5>Arrays</h5>

							respective type (<a href="#value-literal">literal</a>, <a href="#value-objects">object</a>,
							or <a href="#value-url">URL</a>), these values are expressed as [[!json]]&#160;arrays. When
							a property value is a single element, however, the array syntax MAY be omitted.</p>

						<aside class="example" title="Using a text string instead of an array">

						<h5>Publication Language</h5>

						<p>A <a>digital publication</a> has at least one natural language, which is the language that
							the content is expressed in (e.g., English, French, Chinese). The manifest includes the
							following property to set this concept, which can influence, for example, the behavior of a
							user agent (e.g., to preload a dictionary or text-to-speech engine).</p>

						<p>The natural language MUST be well-formed in terms of &#160;[[!bcp47]].</p>

						<p>If a user agent requires the publication language and it is not available in the manifest, or
							the obtained value is invalid, the user agent MAY attempt to determine the publication
							language when <a href="#manifest-processing">generating its canonical representation</a>.
							This specification does not mandate how such a language tag is created. The user agent
							might:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>use the <a>non-empty</a>
								<a href="#manifest-lang-dir">language declaration of the manifest</a>;</li>
							<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default
									reading order</a>;</li>
							<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If a user agent requires a primary language for the publication and more than one language is
							specified, the first entry in the <code>inLanguage</code> array MUST be recognized as the
							primary.</p>

						<p class="note">It is important to differentiate the language <em>of the publication</em> from
							the language of the individual resources that compose it. If such resources are, for
							example, in HTML, the language needs to be set in those resources, too. The language of the
							publication is not inherited.</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<a href="#informative-rel">informative resources</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Informative resources are resources that contain additional information about the

					<section id="accessibility-report">
						<h5>Accessibility Report</h5>

						<p>An accessibility report provides information about the suitability of a <a>digital
								publication</a> for consumption by users with varying preferred reading modalities.
							These reports typically identify the result of an evaluation against established
							accessibility criteria, such as those provided in [[WCAG21]], and are an important source of
							information in determining the usability of a publication.</p>

						<p>An accessibility report is identified using the <code>accessibility-report</code> link
							relation.</p>

						<p class="ednote">The <code>accessibility-report</code> term is not currently registered in the

						<p>The manifest SHOULD include a link to an accessibility report when one is available for a

							publication.</p>

						<p>It is also RECOMMENDED that the accessibility report be provided in a human-readable format,
							such as [[!html]]. Augmenting these reports with machine-processable metadata, such as
							provided in Schema.org [[!schema.org]], is also RECOMMENDED.</p>

						<pre class="example" title="Link to an accessibility report">

						<h5>Preview</h5>

						<p>Not all <a>digital publications</a> will be available to all users (e.g., they might be

							provide a preview of the content in order to entice users to access the full version.</p>

						<p>A <dfn data-lt="preview">preview</dfn> is identified using the <code>preview</code> link

						<h5>Privacy Policy</h5>

						<p>Users often have the legal right to know and control what information is collected about

			</section>

			<section id="mod-compat">
				<h3>Compatibility Requirements</h3>

				<p> In order for a <a>digital publication</a> format to be compatible with this specification, following
					conditions MUST be met: </p>

				<ul>
					<li>It MUST adhere to the manifest format requirements defined in this specification.</li>
					<li>The generic processing steps described in <a href="#manifest-processing"></a> MUST remain valid
						for the extended manifest. To achieve this, and if new terms are added to the general manifest,
						then: <ul>
							<li>The term SHOULD be categorized, if applicable, to one or more of the general term
								categories used in the algorithm (e.g., <a href="#value-array">array</a> or <a
									href="#value-localizable-string">localizable string</a>). This means the relevant
								canonicalization steps will be automatically executed for those terms </li>
							<li>If necessary, the profile MAY define its own canonicalization step, to be executed as
								the <a href="#canonicalization-extension-point">last step of the general
									canonicalization algorithm</a>. Such an extra step MUST NOT invalidate the results
								of any of the steps defined for the <a href="#manifest-processing">processing
									algorithm</a> in general. </li>

			<h2>Processing a Manifest</h2>

			<p>The <dfn data-lt="processing the manifest|processing a manifest|process a manifest">steps for processing

					[[html]] of the document that <a href="#manifest-discovery">references the manifest</a>, when
					available.</li>
			</ul>

			<p class="note">This algorithm does not define how the manifest is discovered and obtained. The steps by
				which to do so are defined by each <a>digital publication</a> format.</p>

			<p class="note">For illustrative purposes, the examples in this section show the structure of internal
				representation as JavaScript objects. User agents can process and internalize the resulting structure in
				whatever language and form is appropriate.</p>

			<h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

			<p>As the manifest is expressed using JSON-LD, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#privacy"
					>privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#iana-considerations">security
					considerations</a> [[!json-ld]] detailed in that specification are applicable to all <a
					href="#extensions">profiles</a> of the manifest.</p>

			<p>Some additional general considerations for profiles include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The location of resources is not defined at the manifest level, so profiles that allow references to
					remotely hosted resources will need to be concerned with Web security principles (e.g., cross-origin
					resource sharing).</li>
				<li>The ability to <a href="#links">link to external resources</a> potentially exposes users to
					malicious content.</li>
				<li>The manifest allows personally identifiable information about a digital publication's creator(s)
					(e.g., names, identifying URLs) to be included, so authoring tools could expose unexpected
					information if explicit author approval of metadata is not required.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>More specific security and privacy considerations are left to each profile to detail, as these will vary
				depending on the nature of the <a>digital publication</a> format.</p>

			<h2>Machine-Processable Table of Contents</h2>

			<section id="app-toc-html-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To facilitate navigation within pages and across sites, HTML uses the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>
					[[html]] to express lists of links. Although generic in nature by default, the purpose of a
						<code>nav</code> element can be more specifically identified by use of the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#aria-role-attribute"><code>role</code> attribute</a>
					[[html]]. In particular, the <code>doc-toc</code> role from the [[dpub-aria-1.0]] vocabulary
					identifies the <code>nav</code> element as the <a>digital publication's</a> table of contents.</p>

				<p>Including an identifiable table of contents is an accessible way to produce any <a>digital
						publication</a>, but due to the flexibility of HTML markup, it also presents challenges for user
					agents trying to extract a meaningful hierarchy of links (e.g., to provide a custom view available
					from any page). To avoid duplicating the tables of contents for different uses, this section defines
					a syntax that is both human friendly and commonly used while still providing enough structure for
					user agent extraction.</p>

				<p>Authors have a choice of lists (ordered or unordered) to construct their table of contents. By
					tagging each link within these lists in anchor tags (<a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
						elements</a>), user agents can easily differentiate the information they need from any
					peripheral content (asides) or stylistic tagging that has also been added. The table of contents can
					consist of both active links (with an <code>href</code> attribute) and inactive links (excluding the
						<code>href</code> attribute), providing additional flexibility in how the table of contents is
					constructed (e.g., to omit links to certain headings or only link to certain content in a
					preview).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="app-toc-html">
				<h3>HTML Structure</h3>

				<p>The table of contents is expressed via an [[!html]]&#160;element (typically a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>).
					This element MUST be identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
						"<code>doc-toc</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document in
						<a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document tree order</a>&#160;[[!dom]]
					with that <code>role</code> value.</p>

				<p>The manifest SHOULD <a href="#table-of-contents">identify the resource</a> that contains the table of
					contents.</p>

				<p>Although the content model of the <code>nav</code> element is not restricted, user agents will only
					be able to extract a usable table of contents when the following markup guidelines are followed:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Table of Contents Title</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although a title for the table of contents is optional, to avoid having a user agent generate
							a placeholder title when one is needed, it is advised to add one. Titles are specified using
							any of the [[html]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements"
									><code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code> elements</a>. Note that only the first such
							element is recognized as the title. If a heading element is not found before the <a
								href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a>, user agents will assume that one has not been
							specified.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-list-links">List of Links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first [[html]] <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"
									><code>ol</code></a> or <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"
								><code>ul</code></a> list element encountered in the <code>nav</code> element is assumed
							to contain the list that defines the links into the content. This list will be found even if
							it is nested inside of <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-div-element"
								><code>div</code></a> elements, for example, as the algorithm <a
								href="#toc-ignored-elements">ignores elements</a> that are not relevant to its
							processing. The list cannot occur inside of any <a href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped
								elements</a>, however, since their internal contents are not evaluated.</p>
						<p>If the <code>nav</code> element does not contain one of these elements, then user agents will
							not register the digital publication as containing a usable table of contents (e.g., a
							machine-rendered option will not be available).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-branches">Branches</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If the table of contents is considered as a tree of links, then each list item (<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-li-element"><code>li</code>
								element</a>) inside of the <a href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a> represents one
							branch. Each of these branches has to have a name and optional destination in order to be
							presented to users, and this information is obtained from the first <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
								element</a> found within the list item, <a href="#toc-ignored-elements">wherever it is
								nested</a> (again, excluding any <code>a</code> elements inside of <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped elements</a>.)</p>
						<p>The link destination for the branch is obtained from the <code>a</code> element's
								<code>href</code> attribute, when specified. This attribute can be omitted if a link is
							not available (e.g., in a preview) or not relevant (e.g., a grouping header). When providing
							a link into the content, it is also possible to specify the relation of the linked document
							(in a <code>rel</code> attribute) and the media type of the linked resource (in a
								<code>type</code> attribute).</p>
						<p>After finding the <code>a</code> element that labels the branch, user agents will continue to
							inspect the markup for another list element (i.e., sub-branches). If a list is found, it is
							similarly processed to extract its links, and so on, until there are no more nested branches
							left to process.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-skipped-elements">Skipped Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A small set of elements are ignored when the parsing table of contents to avoid
							misinterpretation. These are the [[html]] <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#sectioning-content">sectioning content
								elements</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#sectioning-roots"
								>sectioning root elements</a>. The reason they are ignored is because they can defined
							their own outlines (i.e., they can represent embedded content that is self-contained and not
							necessarily related to the structure of content links).</p>
						<p>Any element that has its <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute"><code>hidden</code>
								attribute</a> set is also skipped, since hidden elements are not intended to be directly
							accessed by users.</p>
						<p>Although these elements can be included in the <code>nav</code> element, care has to be taken
							not to embed important content within them (e.g., do not wrap a <code>section</code> element
							around the list item that contains all the links into the content).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-ignored-elements">Ignored Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All elements that are not relevant to extracting the table of contents, and are not <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped</a>, are ignored. Unlike skipped elements, ignoring
							means that user agents will continue to search inside them for relevant content, allowing
							greater flexibility in terms of the tagging that can be used.</p>

				<h3>User Agent Processing</h3>

				<p>This section defines an algorithm for extracting a table of contents from a <code>nav</code> element.
					It is defined in terms of a walk over the nodes of a DOM tree, in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree order</a>, with each node
					being visited when it is <em>entered</em> and when it is <em>exited</em> during the walk. Each time
					a node is visited, it can be seen as triggering an <em>enter</em> or <em>exit</em> event. In some
					steps, user agents are provided a choice in how to process the content to provide flexibility for
					different presentation models.</p>

				<p class="note">For illustrative purposes, the examples in this section show the structure of the table
					of contents as JavaScript objects. User agents can process and internalize the resulting structure
					in whatever language and form is appropriate.</p>

				<p>For the purposes of this algorithm, a <dfn>list element</dfn> is defined as either an [[!html]] <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"><code>ol</code></a> or <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"><code>ul</code></a>
					element.</p>

				<p>The following algorithm MUST be applied to a walk of a DOM subtree rooted at the first
						<code>nav</code> element in document order with the <code>role</code> attribute value
						<code>doc-toc</code>. All explanations are <em>informative</em>.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Let <em>toc</em> be a object that represents the table of contents and initialize it as
							follows:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a <code>name</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents the title of the
								table of contents and set to an empty string.</li>

							<li>Create an <code>entries</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents all the
								branches of the table of contents and set to an empty array.</li>
						</ol>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>This step initializes the <em>toc</em> object that will store the title and the branches
								of the table of contents.</p>
							<aside class="example" title="Visualization of the default toc object">

					<li>
						<p>Initialize a stack.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>The stack is used to hold branches that are not yet complete. As a new sub-branch is
								encountered, the parent gets pushed onto the stack so it can be retrieved later.</p>

					<li>
						<p>Let <em>current toc branch</em> be a variable set to <code>null</code>.</p>
						<details>

						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Walk over the DOM in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree
								order</a>, starting with the <code>nav</code> element the table of contents is being

							and exits it.</p>

									<strong>When entering a <a

								</p>
								<p>Run these steps:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>If the stack is empty, and the <code>name</code> property of <em>toc</em> is
											an empty string, set the <code>name</code> property to one of the
											following:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>the descendant content of the element (to preserve any HTML tags);</li>
											<li>the text string obtained from the descendant content (e.g., by
												calculating the <a
													href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_te"
													>accessible name</a> [[accname-1.1]] of the element).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>If the resulting value of <code>name</code> is an empty string (e.g., after
											removing any presentational elements and trimming all leading and trailing
											whitespace), set the <code>name</code> property either to a placeholder
											value or to <code>null</code>.</p>
									</li>
									<li>Exit the element and continue processing with the next element.</li>
								</ol>
								<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>This step identifies the heading for the table of contents. A heading is only
										processed if the value of the <em>toc</em>
										<code>name</code> property is an empty string (i.e., no headings have yet been
										encountered).</p>
									<p>Whether a user agent sets the <code>name</code> to the descendant content of the
										heading element, or generates a text string from it, depends on whether it will
										re-use any descendant tagging in the presentation (e.g., to retain images,
										MathML, ruby and other content that does not translate to text easily).</p>
									<aside class="example" title="Visualization of the toc object with a heading">

									<p>This algorithm does not process multiple lists in a single branch or at the root

											<code>null</code>), this list is skipped.</p>
									<p>If a list is encountered and the table of contents (<code>toc</code>) still does
										not have a name (i.e., no heading element has been encountered), the table of
										contents is assumed to not have a heading (i.e., the heading for the table of
										contents cannot appear after the first list of entries). The value of the
											<code>name</code> property is changed from an empty string to
											<code>null</code> as no further headings encountered apply, either.</p>

									<p>Exiting a list item indicates that processing of the current branch is complete.
										Before adding this branch to its parent's <code>entries</code> array, the branch
										needs to be tested to see if it has a name and/or any sub-branches. If it does
										not have a name but has sub-branches, the branch is kept. The user agent can
										either supply a placeholder value of its own creation or set the value to null.
										If it does not have a name or any branches, it is invalid and is discarded.</p>
									<p>To determine where to merge the branch, the stack is checked. If there are no
										objects in the stack, it is added into the <code>entries</code> property of the
										root <em>toc</em> object (i.e., it is a top-level branch). Otherwise, it gets
										added into the <code>entries</code> property of the object immediately preceding
										it in the stack.</p>
									<p>As a final step, <em>current toc branch</em> is reset back to
										<code>null</code>.</p>

									<p>This step processes anchor tags to obtain values for the <code>name</code> and

									<p>If the name of the current branch is already defined, then processing of this

										branch).</p>
									<p>Whether a user agent sets the <code>name</code> of the entry to the descendant
										content of the <code>a</code> element, or generates a text string from it,
										depends on whether it will re-use any descendant tagging in the presentation
										(e.g., to retain images, MathML, ruby and other content that does not translate
										to text easily).</p>
									<p>In addition to having an <code>href</code> attribute specified, it is necessary
										that it resolve to a resource that belongs to the digital publication to meet
										the requirements of this specification. If not, the branch is retained but the
										entry will not be linkable.</p>
									<p>Additional information about the target of the link — the type of resource and

									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>As sectioning and sectioning root elements can define their own outlines,

						<p>After completing the DOM walk, if the <em>entries</em> property of <em>toc</em> contains a

						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>If the <code>entries</code> array in the root <em>toc</em> object does not contain any
								branches (either because no list was found in the <code>nav</code> element or the list
								did not contain any conforming list items), then the algorithm did not produce a usable
