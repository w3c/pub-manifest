			<p>This specification defines a general manifest format for expressing information about a digital

			<section id="scope">
				<h3>Scope</h3>

				<p>This specification defines a general manifest format to describe publications. It does not attempt to
					constrain the nature of the publications that use the manifest. Rather, it is designed to be
					adaptable to the needs of specific areas of publishing, such as audiobook production, by specifying
					a modular approach for creating specializations.</p>

				<p>This specification is also intended to facilitate different user agent architectures. While it is
					expected that traditional Web user agents (browsers) will be able to consume a publication manifest,
					this should not limit the capabilities of any other possible type of user agent (e.g., applications,
					whether standalone or running within a user agent, or even publications that include their own user
					interface).</p>

				<p>This specification does not define how user agents are expected to render publications that use the
					manifest format.</p>

				<h3>Terminology</h3>

				<dl>
					<dt>
						<dfn>Bounds</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A <a>digital publication</a> consists of a finite set of resources that represent its
							content. This extent is known as its bounds and is defined within its manifest — it is
							obtained from the union of resources listed in the <a href="#default-reading-order">default
								reading order</a> and <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn data-lt="digital publications|digital publication's">Digital Publication</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The term digital publication refers to a publication authored in a format that uses a

					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn>Internal Representation</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The internal representation of a manifest is the data structure created by user agents when
							they <a href="#manifest-processing">process the manifest</a> and remove all possible
							ambiguities and incorporate any missing values that can be inferred from another source.</p>
						<p>It is possible for the information expressed in the manifest to be the equivalent of the

								order</a>.</p>
					</dd>

					<dt>
						<dfn>Non-empty</dfn>
					</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>For the purposes of this specification, non-empty is used to refer to an element, attribute

							requirements.</p>
						<p>Although profiles can differ in their structural and content requirements, such variances are
							restricted to maintain a high degree of predictabibility between formats. (See <a

			<h2>Publication Manifest</h2>

			<section id="manifest-intro">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<section id="manifest-format" class="informative">
					<h4>Manifest Format</h4>

					<p>A <a>digital publication</a> is described by its <a>manifest</a>, which provides a set of
						properties expressed using a specific shape of JSON-LD&#160;[[json-ld11]] (a variant of
						JSON&#160;[[ecma-404]] for linked data).</p>

					<p>The manifest is what enables user agents to understand the <a>bounds</a> of <a>digital
							publication</a> and the connection between its resources. It includes metadata that
						describes the digital publication, as a publication has an identity and nature beyond its
						constituent resources. The manifest also provides a list of all the resources that belong to the
						digital publication and a default reading order, which is how it connects resources into a
						single contiguous work.</p>

					<p>The properties of the manifest describe the basic information a user agent requires to process
						and render a publication. For ease of understanding, these properties are categorized as
						follows:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<a href="#descriptive-properties">Descriptive properties</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Descriptive properties describe aspects of a digital publication, such as its <a
									href="#pub-title">title</a>, <a href="#creators">creator</a>, and <a
									href="#language-and-dir">language</a>.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							<a href="#resource-categorization-properties">Resource categorization properties</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Resource categorization properties describe or identify common sets of resources, such as
								the <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order"
									>default reading order</a>. These properties refer to one or more resources, such as
								HTML documents, images, scripts, and metadata records.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p>The <a>manifest</a> also identifies key resources of a digital publication through the use of
						link relations. These relations are applied to the <a href="#dom-linkedresource-rel"
								><code>rel</code> property</a> of <a href="#LinkedResource"><code>LinkedResource</code>
							objects</a> (e.g., the links found in the <a href="#pub-table-of-contents">table of
							contents</a> and <a href="#resource-list">resource list</a>).</p>

					<p>The types of resources these relations identify are categorized as follows:</p>

					<dl>
						<dt>
							<a href="#informative-rel">Informative resources</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Informative resources are resources that contain additional information about the
								publication, such as its <a href="#privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>, <a
									href="#accessibility-report">accessibility report</a>, or <a href="#preview"
									>preview</a>.</p>
						</dd>
						<dt>
							<a href="#structural-rel">Structural resources</a>
						</dt>
						<dd>
							<p>Structural resources are key meta structures of the publication, such as the <a
									href="#cover">cover image</a>, <a href="#table-of-contents">table of contents</a>,
								and <a href="#page-list">page list</a>.</p>
						</dd>
					</dl>

					<p class="note">These categorizations have no relevance outside this specification (i.e., the
						properties are not actually grouped together in the manifest).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-jsonld">
					<h4>JSON-LD Authoring and Processing</h4>

					<p>This specification defines the publication manifest as a specific "shape" of [[!json-ld11]]. This
						means that the manifest SHOULD be expressed using only the syntactic constructions defined in
						this specification, as opposed to all the possibilities offered by the JSON-LD syntax.</p>

					<p class="note">This shape is also defined, informally, through a JSON schema&#160;[[json-schema]]
						that expresses the constraints defined in this specification. This schema is maintained at <a
							href="https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/blob/master/schema/publication.schema.json"
							>https://github.com/w3c/pub-manifest/blob/master/schema/publication.schema.json</a>.</p>

					<p>The publication manifest also has a number of authoring flexibilities and compact authoring
						expressions. For example, it is not always required that object types be explicitly authored, as
						these are automatically generated during processing when missing (see <a href="#value-objects"
						></a> for more information). An <a>internal representation</a> of the manifest data is defined
						separately; see the separate section on <a href="#webidl"></a> for further details.</p>

					<p>As a consequence, a user agent does not have to be a full JSON-LD processor. User agents only
						need to be able to read the manifest's specific shape and internalize the data.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="manifest-schemaorg">
					<h4>Relationship to Schema.org</h4>

					<p>Manifest properties, in particular those categorized as <a href="#descriptive-properties"
							>descriptive properties</a>, are primarily drawn from <a href="https://schema.org"
							>schema.org</a> and its <a href="https://schema.org/docs/schemas.html">hosted
						extensions</a>&#160;[[!schema.org]]. As a consequence, these properties inherit their syntax and
						semantics from schema.org, making manifest authoring compatible with schema.org authoring.</p>

					<p>When a manifest item corresponds to a schema.org property, its <a href="#manifest-properties"
							>property definition</a> identifies its mapping and includes the defining type (e.g., <a
							href="https://schema.org/CreativeWork">CreativeWork</a> or <a href="https://schema.org/Book"
							>Book</a>) in parentheses.</p>

					<p>Schema.org additionally includes a large number of properties that, though relevant for
						publishing, are not mentioned in this specification. These properties MAY be used in a manifest
						as this document defines only the minimal set of manifest items.</p>

					<p>When using additional schema.org properties, ensure that they are valid for the <a
							href="#publication-types">type of publication</a> specified in the manifest. Properties are
						often available in many schema.org types, as a result of the inheritance model used by the
						vocabulary, but not all properties are available for all types. For more detailed information
						about which types accept which properties, refer to [[!schema.org]].</p>

					<p>More information about using additional schema.org properties is also available in <a
							href="#publication-types"></a> and <a href="#extensibility-manifest-properties"></a></p>
				</section>
			</section>

			<section id="manifest-requirements">
				<h5>Requirements</h5>

				<p>The following properties MUST be set in the manifest:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="#manifest-context">context</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#publication-types">type</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#profile-conformance">conformsTo</a>
					</li>
				</ul>

				<p>The priority of all other <a href="#manifest-properties">properties</a> and <a href="#manifest-rel"
						>resource relations</a> is OPTIONAL, but MAY be modified by implementations of the manifest
					format.</p>

				<p class="note">Some properties are implicitly required, as they are compiled from alternative
					information when not explicitly authored. See <a href="#webidl"></a> for more information.</p>
			</section>

			<section id="webidl">
				<h3>Web IDL</h3>

				<p>Although a <a>digital publication</a>'s manifest is authored as [[!json-ld11]], a user agent <a
						href="#manifest-processing">processes this information</a> into the <a>internal
						representation</a>, which can be in any language, in order to utilize the properties.</p>

				<p>To simplify the manifest format for developers, this specification defines an abstract representation
					of the data structures employed by the manifest using the Web Interface Definition Language (Web
					IDL)&#160;[[!webidl-1]] — <a href="#webidl-wpm">the <code>PublicationManifest</code>
					dictionary</a>.</p>

				<p>This definition expresses the expected names, datatypes, and possible restrictions for each member of
					the manifest. Unlike a typical Web IDL definition, however, user agents are not expected to expose
					the information in the manifest as an API. The Web IDL language is chosen solely to provide an
					abstraction of the data model.</p>

				<p>The required members of the <code>PublicationManifest</code> dictionary do not exactly match <a
						href="#manifest-requirements">the required members of the manifest</a> as user agents are
					expected to compile information from other sources in the absence of an explicit declaration for
					some properties (e.g., for the <a href="#pub-title">title</a> and <a href="#default-reading-order"
						>reading order</a>).</p>

				<p class="note">It is not necessary to understand the Web IDL definition in order to create digital
					publications. Authoring requirements are defined in the following sections.</p>

				<h3>Value Categories</h3>

				<section id="value-literal">
					<h4>Literals</h4>

					<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects a literal text string as its

						MUST be expressed as a [[!json]] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.5"
							>string</a>.</p>

					<p>Literal values are not changed <a href="#manifest-processing">during processing of the

							>converted to objects</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="value-number">
					<h4>Numbers</h4>

					<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects a number as its value, the
						value MUST be expressed as a [[!json]] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.4"
							>number</a>.</p>
				</section>

				<section id="value-boolean">
					<h4>Booleans</h4>

					<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects a boolean as its value, the
						value MUST be expressed as an [[!ecmascript]]&#160;<a
							data-cite="ecmascript#sec-terms-and-definitions-boolean-value">Boolean value</a>
							(<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>).</p>
				</section>

				<section id="value-objects">
					<h4>Explicit and Implied Objects</h4>

					<p>Various manifest properties are expected to be expressed as [[!json]]&#160;<a
							href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.2">objects</a>. Although the use of
						objects is usually recommended, the following sections identify cases where it is also
						acceptable to use string values that are interpreted as objects depending on the context. The
						exact mapping of text values to objects is part of the property or object definitions.</p>

					<section id="value-localizable-string">
						<h5>Localizable Strings</h5>

						<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects a localizable text string
							as its value, the value MUST be expressed either as:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>a [[!json]] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.5">string</a> value;
								or</li>
							<li>A <code>LocalizableString</code>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>A single string value represents an implied object whose <code>value</code> property is the
							string's text and whose language is determined from other information in the manifest.</p>

						<p>A <code>LocalizableString</code> is a [[!json]]&#160;<a
								href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.2">object</a> consisting of the
							following properties:</p>

						<table class="zebra" data-dfn-for="LocalizableString">
							<thead>
								<tr>
									<th>Term</th>
									<th>Description</th>
									<th>Required Value</th>
									<th>Value Type</th>
									<th>[[!schema.org]] Mapping</th>
								</tr>
							</thead>
							<tbody>
								<tr>
									<td>
										<code>
											<dfn>value</dfn>
										</code>
									</td>
									<td>The value of the localizable string. REQUIRED.</td>
									<td>Text.</td>
									<td><a href="#value-literal">Literal</a></td>
									<td>(None)</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										<code>
											<dfn>language</dfn>
										</code>
									</td>
									<td>The language of the value. OPTIONAL.</td>
									<td>A <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47#section-2.2.9">well-formed language
											tag</a>&#160;[[!bcp47]].</td>
									<td><a href="#value-literal">Literal</a></td>
									<td>(None)</td>
								</tr>
								<tr>
									<td>
										<code>
											<dfn>direction</dfn>
										</code>
									</td>
									<td>The base direction of the value. OPTIONAL.</td>
									<td><code>ltr</code> or <code>rtl</code></td>
									<td><a href="#value-literal">Literal</a></td>
									<td>(None)</td>
								</tr>
							</tbody>
						</table>

						<p>The meaning of the base <dfn>direction</dfn> values are:</p>

						<ul data-dfn-for="TextDirection">
							<li><code><dfn>ltr</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual value is explicitly directionally set to left-to-right text;</li>
							<li><code><dfn>rtl</dfn></code>: indicates that the textual value is explicitly directionally set to right-to-left text;</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							A missing base direction value means that that the textual value is explicitly directionally set to the direction of the first character with a strong directionality, following the rules of the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm&#160;[[!bidi]].</li>
						</p>	

						<aside class="example" title="Set the language of a string">
						<pre>{
    "value"     : "孔子",
    "language"  : "zh"
}</pre>
						</aside>
						<aside  class="example" title="Set the language and the base direction of a string">
<pre>{
    "value"     : "<bdo dir="ltr">HTML היא שפת סימון.</bdo>",
    "language"  : "he",
    "direction" : "rtl"
}</pre>
					</aside>
					<div class=note>
						<p>
							If the base direction value were not set in the last example, the text would be displayed, following the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm&nbsp;[[bidi]] and due to the presence of a Latin character starting the string, as:
						</p>
						<p dir="ltr">HTML היא שפת סימון.</p>		
						<p>
							However, that would be incorrect. The extra <code>direction</code> value is necessary to control the display to yield:
						</p>
						<p dir="rtl">HTML היא שפת סימון.</p> 
						<p>See also the [[string-meta]] document for further explanations and examples.</p>
					</div>


					</section>

					<section id="value-entity">
						<h6>Entities</h6>

						<p>When a <a href="#manifest-properties">manifest</a> property expects an entity (i.e., an
							individual or organization responsible for the various aspects of creation), its value MUST
							be expressed either as:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>a [[!json]] <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4627#section-2.5">string</a> value;
								or</li>
							<li>an <code>Entity</code>.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>A single string value represents an instance of an <code>Entity</code> object whose

					<h4>URLs</h4>

					<p><dfn data-lt="URL">URLs</dfn> are used to identify resources associated with a <a>digital

						string</a>&#160;[[!url]].</p>

					<p>Manifest URLs are restricted to only the <code>http</code> and <code>https</code>

							href="https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-base-url">base URL</a>&#160;[[!url]].</p>

					<p>The base URL for relative-URL strings is determined as follows:</p>

					<ul>

							resource.</li>
						<li>In the case of a digital publication format that uses <a href="#manifest-other-discovery"
								>another means of discovering the manifest</a>, it is defined by the format.</li>
					</ul>

					<p>By consequence, relative-URL strings in embedded manifests are resolved against the URL of the
						document that references the manifest <em>unless</em> the document declares a base URL (i.e., in

						<p>A <a>digital publication</a> has at least one natural language, which is the language that

							created. The user agent might:</p>

						<ul>
							<li>use the <a>non-empty</a>
								<a href="#manifest-lang-dir">language declaration of the manifest</a>;</li>
							<li>use the first non-empty language declaration found in a resource in the <a>default

							<li>calculate the language using its own algorithm.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>If a user agent requires a primary language for the publication and more than one language is
							specified, the first entry in the <code>inLanguage</code> array MUST be recognized as the
							primary.</p>

						<p class="note">It is important to differentiate the language <em>of the publication</em> from
							the language of the individual resources that compose it. If such resources are, for
							example, in HTML, the language needs to be set in those resources, too. The language of the

						<p>Users often have the legal right to know and control what information is collected about
							them, how such information is stored and for how long, whether it is personally
							identifiable, and how it can be expunged. Including a statement that addresses such privacy

						<p>A link to a privacy policy can be included in the manifest for this purposes. It is

			<h2>Processing a Manifest</h2>

			<p>The <dfn data-lt="processing the manifest|processing a manifest|process a manifest">steps for processing
					a manifest</dfn> into its <a>internal representation</a> are given by the following algorithm.</p>

			<p>The following error types are used in this algorithm:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><dfn data-lt="validation errors">validation error</dfn> &#8212; a non-terminating error that occurs
					when the value of a property does match its expected input.</li>
				<li><dfn data-lt="fatal errors">fatal error</dfn> &#8212; a terminating error that results, for example,
					when a manifest cannot be processed or does not match critical validity constraints.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>User agents SHOULD NOT include in their internal representation any value that generates a <a>validation
					error</a>.</p>

			<p>User agents SHOULD expose both validation and fatal errors, but this specification does not prescribe the
				manner in which this has to be done.</p>

			<p>The algorithm takes the following arguments:</p>

			<ul>
				<li><var>text</var>: a UTF-8 string containing the manifest;</li>
				<li><var>base</var>: a URL string that represents the base URL for the manifest.</li>
				<li><var>document</var>: the <a data-cite="html#the-document-object">HTML Document (DOM)
					Node</a>&#160;[[!html]] of the document that <a href="#manifest-discovery">references the
						manifest</a>, when available.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>If successful, the algorithm returns an object containing the internal representation of the data.</p>

			<p class="note">This algorithm does not define how the manifest is discovered and obtained. The steps by
				which to do so are defined by each <a>digital publication</a> format.</p>

			<p class="note">For illustrative purposes, the examples in this section show the structure of internal

			<h2>Modular Extensions</h2>

			<p>The manifest format defined in this specification is designed to be implemented and extended by
				publishing communities in the production of new <a>profiles</a> (e.g., audiobooks and scholarly
				publications). The flexibility the manifest format offers allows it to be tailored to each community's
				specific needs while also providing a common base for user agents that need to process the profiles
				(i.e., minimizing the differences between each profile and simplifying interoperability).</p>

			<p>In order for a profile to be compatible with this specification, the following conditions MUST be met: </p>

			<ol>
				<li>It MUST adhere to the requirements for constructing a manifest as defined in <a href="#manifest"
					></a>.</li>
				<li>It MUST define a unique conformance URL and require that conforming publications include this URL in
					their <a href="conforms-to"><code>conformsTo</code> property</a>.</li>
				<li>One or both <a href="#manifest-link">linking methods</a> MUST be used in the discovery of the
					manifest.</li>
				<li>The generic processing steps described in <a href="#manifest-processing"></a> MUST remain valid for
					the extended manifest. To achieve this, and if new terms are added to the general manifest, then: <ul>
						<li>The term SHOULD be categorized, if applicable, to one or more of the general term categories
							used in the algorithm (e.g., <a href="#value-array">array</a> or <a
								href="#value-localizable-string">localizable string</a>). This means the relevant
							processing steps will be automatically executed for those terms </li>
						<li>If necessary, the profile MAY define its own processing step(s), to be executed at the
							designated extension points within the <a href="#manifest-processing">processing
								algorithm</a>. Such extra steps MUST NOT invalidate the results of any of the steps
							defined for the <a href="#manifest-processing">processing algorithm</a> in general.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p class="ednote"> Adding an example of a term added by, e.g., the audiobook profile would be a good idea,
				when available. </p>
		</section>
		<section id="security-privacy">
			<h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

			<p>As the manifest is expressed using JSON-LD, the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#privacy"
					>privacy</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/json-ld11/#iana-considerations">security
					considerations</a> [[!json-ld11]] detailed in that specification are applicable to all <a
					href="#extensions">profiles</a> of the manifest.</p>

			<p>Some additional general considerations for profiles include:</p>

			<ul>
				<li>The location of resources is not defined at the manifest level, so profiles that allow references to
					remotely hosted resources will need to be concerned with Web security principles (e.g., cross-origin
					resource sharing).</li>
				<li>The ability to <a href="#links">link to external resources</a> potentially exposes users to
					malicious content.</li>
				<li>The manifest allows personally identifiable information about a digital publication's creator(s)
					(e.g., names, identifying URLs) to be included, so authoring tools could expose unexpected
					information if explicit author approval of metadata is not required.</li>
			</ul>

			<p>More specific security and privacy considerations are left to each profile to detail, as these will vary
				depending on the nature of the <a>digital publication</a> format.</p>

			<h2>Machine-Processable Table of Contents</h2>

			<section id="app-toc-html-intro" class="informative">
				<h3>Introduction</h3>

				<p>To facilitate navigation within pages and across sites, HTML uses the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code>
					element</a>&#160;[[html]] to express lists of links. Although generic in nature by default, the
					purpose of a <code>nav</code> element can be more specifically identified by use of the <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#aria-role-attribute"><code>role</code>
					attribute</a>&#160;[[html]]. In particular, the <code>doc-toc</code> role from the [[dpub-aria-1.0]]
					vocabulary identifies the <code>nav</code> element as the <a>digital publication's</a> table of
					contents.</p>

				<p>Including an identifiable table of contents is an accessible way to produce any <a>digital
						publication</a>, but due to the flexibility of HTML markup, it also presents challenges for user
					agents trying to extract a meaningful hierarchy of links (e.g., to provide a custom view available
					from any page). To avoid duplicating the tables of contents for different uses, this section defines
					a syntax that is both human friendly and commonly used while still providing enough structure for
					user agent extraction.</p>

				<p>Authors have a choice of lists (ordered or unordered) to construct their table of contents. By
					tagging each link within these lists in anchor tags (<a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
						elements</a>), user agents can easily differentiate the information they need from any
					peripheral content (asides) or stylistic tagging that has also been added. The table of contents can
					consist of both active links (with an <code>href</code> attribute) and inactive links (excluding the
						<code>href</code> attribute), providing additional flexibility in how the table of contents is
					constructed (e.g., to omit links to certain headings or only link to certain content in a
					preview).</p>
			</section>

			<section id="app-toc-html">
				<h3>HTML Structure</h3>

				<p>The table of contents is expressed via an [[!html]]&#160;element (typically a <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-nav-element"><code>nav</code> element</a>).
					This element MUST be identified by the <code>role</code> attribute&#160;[[!html]] value
						"<code>doc-toc</code>"&#160;[[!dpub-aria-1.0]], and MUST be the first element in the document in
						<a href="https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/#concept-tree-order">document tree order</a>&#160;[[!dom]]
					with that <code>role</code> value.</p>

				<p>The manifest SHOULD <a href="#table-of-contents">identify the resource</a> that contains the table of
					contents.</p>

				<p>Although the content model of the <code>nav</code> element is not restricted, user agents will only
					be able to extract a usable table of contents when the following markup guidelines are followed:</p>

				<dl>
					<dt>Table of Contents Title</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>Although a title for the table of contents is optional, to avoid having a user agent generate
							a placeholder title when one is needed, it is advised to add one. Titles are specified using
							any of the [[!html]]&#160;<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#the-h1-h2-h3-h4-h5-and-h6-elements"
									><code>h1</code> through <code>h6</code> elements</a>. Note that only the first such
							element is recognized as the title. If a heading element is not found before the <a
								href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a>, user agents will assume that one has not been
							specified.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-list-links">List of Links</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>The first [[!html]]&#160;<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"
								><code>ol</code></a> or <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"
								><code>ul</code></a> list element encountered in the <code>nav</code> element is assumed
							to contain the list that defines the links into the content. This list will be found even if
							it is nested inside of <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-div-element"
								><code>div</code></a> elements, for example, as the algorithm <a
								href="#toc-ignored-elements">ignores elements</a> that are not relevant to its
							processing. The list cannot occur inside of any <a href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped
								elements</a>, however, since their internal contents are not evaluated.</p>
						<p>If the <code>nav</code> element does not contain one of these elements, then user agents will
							not register the digital publication as containing a usable table of contents (e.g., a
							machine-rendered option will not be available).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-branches">Branches</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>If the table of contents is considered as a tree of links, then each list item (<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-li-element"><code>li</code>
								element</a>) inside of the <a href="#toc-list-links">list of links</a> represents one
							branch. Each of these branches has to have a name and optional destination in order to be
							presented to users, and this information is obtained from the first <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/textlevel-semantics.html#the-a-element"><code>a</code>
								element</a> found within the list item, <a href="#toc-ignored-elements">wherever it is
								nested</a> (again, excluding any <code>a</code> elements inside of <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped elements</a>.)</p>
						<p>The link destination for the branch is obtained from the <code>a</code> element's
								<code>href</code> attribute, when specified. This attribute can be omitted if a link is
							not available (e.g., in a preview) or not relevant (e.g., a grouping header). When providing
							a link into the content, it is also possible to specify the relation of the linked document
							(in a <code>rel</code> attribute) and the media type of the linked resource (in a
								<code>type</code> attribute).</p>
						<p>After finding the <code>a</code> element that labels the branch, user agents will continue to
							inspect the markup for another list element (i.e., sub-branches). If a list is found, it is
							similarly processed to extract its links, and so on, until there are no more nested branches
							left to process.</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-skipped-elements">Skipped Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>A small set of elements are ignored when the parsing table of contents to avoid
							misinterpretation. These are the [[!html]]&#160;<a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#sectioning-content">sectioning content
								elements</a> and <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/sections.html#sectioning-roots"
								>sectioning root elements</a>. The reason they are ignored is because they can defined
							their own outlines (i.e., they can represent embedded content that is self-contained and not
							necessarily related to the structure of content links).</p>
						<p>Any element that has its <a
								href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/editing.html#the-hidden-attribute"><code>hidden</code>
								attribute</a> set is also skipped, since hidden elements are not intended to be directly
							accessed by users.</p>
						<p>Although these elements can be included in the <code>nav</code> element, care has to be taken
							not to embed important content within them (e.g., do not wrap a <code>section</code> element
							around the list item that contains all the links into the content).</p>
					</dd>
					<dt id="toc-ignored-elements">Ignored Elements</dt>
					<dd>
						<p>All elements that are not relevant to extracting the table of contents, and are not <a
								href="#toc-skipped-elements">skipped</a>, are ignored. Unlike skipped elements, ignoring
							means that user agents will continue to search inside them for relevant content, allowing
							greater flexibility in terms of the tagging that can be used.</p>

				<h3>User Agent Processing</h3>

				<p>This section defines an algorithm for extracting a table of contents from a <code>nav</code> element.
					It is defined in terms of a walk over the nodes of a DOM tree, in <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree order</a>, with each node
					being visited when it is <em>entered</em> and when it is <em>exited</em> during the walk. Each time
					a node is visited, it can be seen as triggering an <em>enter</em> or <em>exit</em> event. In some
					steps, user agents are provided a choice in how to process the content to provide flexibility for
					different presentation models.</p>

				<p class="note">For illustrative purposes, the examples in this section show the structure of the table
					of contents as JavaScript objects. User agents can process and internalize the resulting structure
					in whatever language and form is appropriate.</p>

				<p>For the purposes of this algorithm, a <dfn>list element</dfn> is defined as either an
						[[!html]]&#160;<a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ol-element"
							><code>ol</code></a> or <a
						href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-ul-element"><code>ul</code></a>
					element.</p>

				<p>The following algorithm MUST be applied to a walk of a DOM subtree rooted at the first
						<code>nav</code> element in document order with the <code>role</code> attribute value
						<code>doc-toc</code>. All explanations are <em>informative</em>.</p>

				<ol>
					<li>
						<p>Let <em>toc</em> be a object that represents the table of contents and initialize it as
							follows:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Create a <code>name</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents the title of the
								table of contents and set to an empty string.</li>

							<li>Create an <code>entries</code> property for <em>toc</em> that represents all the
								branches of the table of contents and set to an empty array.</li>
						</ol>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>This step initializes the <em>toc</em> object that will store the title and the branches
								of the table of contents.</p>
							<pre class="example" title="Visualization of the default toc object.">{
    "name"    : '',
    "entries" : []
}</pre>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Initialize a stack.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p>The stack is used to hold branches that are not yet complete. As a new sub-branch is
								encountered, the parent gets pushed onto the stack so it can be retrieved later.</p>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Let <em>current toc branch</em> be a variable set to <code>null</code>.</p>
						<details>
							<summary>Explanation</summary>
							<p><em>current toc branch</em> is used to hold the object that represents the branch of the
								table of contents that is currently being processed.</p>
						</details>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Walk over the DOM in <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#tree-order">tree
								order</a>, starting with the <code>nav</code> element the table of contents is being
							built from, and trigger the first relevant step below for each element as the walk enters
							and exits it.</p>
						<ol>
							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>When entering a <a
											href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#heading-content-2">heading
											content</a> element:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Run these steps:</p>
								<ol>
									<li>
										<p>If the stack is empty, and the <code>name</code> property of <em>toc</em> is
											an empty string, set the <code>name</code> property to one of the
											following:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>the descendant content of the element (to preserve any HTML tags);</li>
											<li>the text string obtained from the descendant content (e.g., by
												calculating the <a
													href="https://www.w3.org/TR/accname-1.1/#mapping_additional_nd_te"
													>accessible name</a>&#160;[[accname-1.1]] of the element).</li>
										</ul>
										<p>If the resulting value of <code>name</code> is an empty string (e.g., after
											removing any presentational elements and trimming all leading and trailing
											whitespace), set the <code>name</code> property either to a placeholder
											value or to <code>null</code>.</p>
									</li>
									<li>Exit the element and continue processing with the next element.</li>
								</ol>
								<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>This step identifies the heading for the table of contents. A heading is only
										processed if the value of the <em>toc</em>
										<code>name</code> property is an empty string (i.e., no headings have yet been
										encountered).</p>
									<p>Whether a user agent sets the <code>name</code> to the descendant content of the
										heading element, or generates a text string from it, depends on whether it will
										re-use any descendant tagging in the presentation (e.g., to retain images,
										MathML, ruby and other content that does not translate to text easily).</p>
									<pre class="example" title="Visualization of the toc object with a heading.">{
    "name"    : "Contents",
    "entries" : []
}</pre>
									<p>If the <code>name</code> is not an empty string, or is <code>null</code>, then a
										previous heading has already been encountered or content has been encountered
										that indicates the <code>nav</code> element does not have a heading (e.g., a
										list has already been processed, since the heading would not follow the list of
										links).</p>
									<pre class="example" title="Visualization of the toc object without a heading.">{
    "name"    : null,
    "entries" : []
}</pre>
									<p>If a heading is not specified, the user agent can provide its own for later
										use.</p>
								</details>
							</li>

							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>When entering a <a>list element</a>:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>Run these steps:</p>

									</li>
									<li>

										<ol>
											<li>If the <code>entries</code> property of <em>current toc branch</em> is
													<code>null</code> or a non-empty array, exit the element and

											<li>Otherwise, do nothing.</li>
										</ol>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>This algorithm does not process multiple lists in a single branch or at the root
										of the <code>nav</code> element, so if a list has already been encountered (the
											<code>entries</code> property contains one or more branches or is set to
											<code>null</code>), this list is skipped.</p>
									<p>If a list is encountered and the table of contents (<code>toc</code>) still does
										not have a name (i.e., no heading element has been encountered), the table of
										contents is assumed to not have a heading (i.e., the heading for the table of
										contents cannot appear after the first list of entries). The value of the
											<code>name</code> property is changed from an empty string to
											<code>null</code> as no further headings encountered apply, either.</p>

							<li>
								<p>
									<strong>When exiting a <a>list element</a>:</strong>
								</p>
								<p>If the stack is not empty, pop the top object off the stack and set <em>current toc
										branch</em> to it.</p>

									<li>Set <em>current toc branch</em> to a new object.</li>

									<li>Create <code>name</code>, <code>url</code>, <code>type</code>, and

									</li>
									<li>
										<p>If the stack contains one or more entries:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>If the <code>entries</code> property of <em>current toc branch</em>

											<li>If the <code>entries</code> property of <em>current toc branch</em>
												contains an empty array, and its <code>name</code> property is an empty
												string, set <em>current toc branch</em> to null and exit this processing
												step.</li>
										</ol>
										<p>Add <em>current toc branch</em> to the array in the <code>entries</code>
											property of the object at the top of the stack.</p>
									</li>
									<li>
										<p>Otherwise, add the object in <em>current toc branch</em> to the
												<code>entries</code> array of <em>toc</em>.</p>
									</li>

									<li>
										<p>Set <em>current toc branch</em> to <code>null</code>.</p>
									</li>
								</ol>
								<details>
									<summary>Explanation</summary>
									<p>Exiting a list item indicates that processing of the current branch is complete.
										Before adding this branch to its parent's <code>entries</code> array, the branch
										needs to be tested to see if it has a name and/or any sub-branches. If it does
										not have a name but has sub-branches, the branch is kept. The user agent can
										either supply a placeholder value of its own creation or set the value to null.
										If it does not have a name or any branches, it is invalid and is discarded.</p>
									<p>To determine where to merge the branch, the stack is checked. If there are no
										objects in the stack, it is added into the <code>entries</code> property of the
										root <em>toc</em> object (i.e., it is a top-level branch). Otherwise, it gets
										added into the <code>entries</code> property of the object immediately preceding
										it in the stack.</p>
									<p>As a final step, <em>current toc branch</em> is reset back to
										<code>null</code>.</p>
									<aside class="example" title="Visualization of a branch merge.">

			<h4>JSON-LD 1.1 Dependency</h4>
			<p>
				This specification depends on [[json-ld11]], which is, at the time of finalizing this specification, the latest version of JSON-LD. I.e., a JSON-LD&nbsp;1.0&nbsp;[[json-ld10]] processor raises errors if it processes a manifest as defined in this document.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, the 1.1 dependency is restricted to the usage of the <a>direction</a> term, defined in <a href="#value-localizable-string"></a>. If the manifest does not use this feature, it can be processed by a JSON-LD&nbsp;1.0 processor provided the context reference <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context</code> (see <a href="#manifest-context"></a>) is replaced by <code>https://www.w3.org/ns/pub-context-jsonld10</code>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that this is relevant if and only if the manifest is indeed processed by a JSON-LD processor. As emphasized in <a href="#manifest-jsonld"></a>, a user agent is not required to be based on such a processor, in which case this dependency does not create any problems.
